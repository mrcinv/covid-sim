**The only numbers used in the computations are daily reported cases (and for the case of Slovenia also the daily number of tests performed).** No other information of any kind, however relevant, is used. No estimates, assumptions, simulations, comparisons with other outbreaks etc for any epidemiological parameters are accounted for, let alone the changing effects of countermeasures or other dynamic factors.

For each forecast only data from the past 3 weeks is used. The assumption that after three weeks people are no longer spread the virus so older data can be discarded.

The the theory used to obtain these estimates is explained under [Theory](theory.md).

### Slovenia

The following graph shows the current (as of **April 15**) best fit for total number of cases. For the case of Slovenia the numbers of daily confirmed cases are normalised with respect to number of daily tests. As a result the fit has been tighter and estimates have been more accurate than for other countries.

This plot shows the daily increases and estimates (together with rough error estimates) and the current projected curve.
